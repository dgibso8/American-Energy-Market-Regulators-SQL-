<h1>American Energy Market Regulators</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
From 2016-2017 the American Energy Market Regulators received an increase in the number of outages from energy companies. I analyzed the company's energy data to identify where the outages, specifically forced outages, were coming from. Our goal was to reduce the number of outages by 10% by identifying frequency, time offline and total amount of energy lost per sector.  Applied SQL queries to analyze energy sector data, accurately identifying three participants responsible for more than 55% of the lost energy, thus saving the energy company 51.2k MW per year.  Created advanced SQL queries, CTEs, CASE statements, and aggregate functions, to discover that forced outages had increased by approximately 28% and the duration offline increased by 50%.
